# Kmonad-with-KOY-layout
This is my attempt at building a KOY layout Kmonad 100% Keymap...

The origin of my thoughts and ideas is from https://github.com/HenryJobst/kmonad 
Thank you, Henry! You da man!
But unfortunatley, Henry is a full fledched NERD.
Half of his keybindings are strange AF.
So I decided to do it myself.

Well, spoiler alert- It doesnÂ´t work right now...
