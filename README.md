# Kmonad-with-VOU-layout
This is my attempt at building a VOU layout Kmonad 100% Keymap...

The origin of my thoughts and ideas is from https://github.com/HenryJobst/kmonad 
Thank you, Henry! You da man!
But unfortunatley, Henry is a full fledched NERD.
Half of his keybindings are strange AF.
So I decided to do it myself.

Well, spoiler alert- It didn't work out of the box!

First I started with koy, but soon I found VOU to better fit my needs.

And eventually this code, "Liebeskind V4", is working.
Base layout VOU, but the third level more like NEO.

Intended use for german programmers.
Just choose US- International keyboard layout inside windows 10.

Linux- in progress.

AMA!
